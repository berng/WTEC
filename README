GetWTEC
Authors: S.V.Voeykov, O.I.Berngardt
The work was done under support of the joint grant #17-45-388072r_a of RFBR and Goverment of Irkutsk Region, Russia.

Purpose of the program:
The software calculates the WTEC index. 
Wtec is a GNSS index (Variations of Vertical TEC index), 
which is equal to mean TEC variation (with periods less than the 
specified ones) amplitude for a single GPS/GLONASS site. 
The user can made a multisite processing: for each site 
software calculate corresponding index. The maximum duration 
of the Wtec series is one year. The basic method of WTEC calculation 
is described in [Voeykov S.V., Berngardt O.I., Shestakov N.V. 
Geomagnetism and Aeronomy, 2016, Vol. 56, No. 2, pp. 219–228].

Input data:
The input data is the output files (so called dat-files) of the 
tec-suite software by Ilya Zhivetiev (www.gnss-lab.org). The dat-files 
contain total electron content calculated from different measurements. 
In the dat-files among others the following columns should be presented: 
tsn, el, az, tec.l1l2 (which are record number, elevation, azimuth, TEC 
based on L1, L2 measurements).

Files and directories included in the software package:
1) Executable file – GetWTEC.
2) Configuration file – GetWTEC.dia.
3) Service directories – out, genout (will be created automatically).
4) File with program description - README (this file).

Configuration file (GetWTEC.dia).
pssint.dia contains following configuration information: 
__________________________________________________________________________
e:\gps\dat\   	- datway – way to dat-files
0  	  - crit_all =1 – processing of all sites
LIST 	  - site – site name (if crit_all =0)
2016 	  - year
1  	  - daybeg - the first of the processed days
366  	  - dayend - the last of the processed days
300. 	  - hmax - height for calculating the coordinates of ionospheric points (km)
10. 	  - highper - window for removing slow variations (minutes)
15. 	  - gamcutoff – minimum elevation (deg)
55  	  - prncutoff - the maximum number of satellites to process
0  	  - GNSS_crit =0 – all satellites, =1 – GPS only, =2 – GLONASS only
999 	  - GrossDir - "main" direction for processing, if =999 – common file only
4  	  - NofDirs – number of azimuth sectors (no more than 4)
__________________________________________________________________________

‘datway’ – way to directory with input dat-files. 

The ‘daybeg’ and  ‘dayend’ parameters define the limits of the 
interval of processed  days (it means the days of the year). 

If crit_all = 1 – all the sites found in the directory 
[datway]\[year]\[daybeg] are processed. If crit_all = 0 – only the site 
specified in the ‘site’ parameter is processed. 

The parameter ‘hmax’ specifies the height for calculating the coordinates 
of ionospheric points. 

The ‘highper’ parameter specifies the window in minutes used to remove 
slow variations by the moving average method. 

The ‘gamcutoff’ parameter specifies the minimum value of the elevation 
angle for satellites. 

The ‘prncutoff’ parameter specifies the maximum number of satellites 
whose data is used in processing. 

The ‘GNSS_crit’ criterion determines which satellite systems will be 
used (=0 – all satellites, =1 – GPS only, =2 – GLONASS only). 

With the parameters ‘GrossDir’ and ‘NofDirs’, one can specify additional 
output files with data in certain azimuth sectors relative to the processed 
station. ‘NofDirs’ specifies the number of sectors (no more than 4). 
‘GrossDir’ sets the reference center direction for the first sector. 
If GrossDir = 999 – only the common file will be output.

Operating procedure:
1) Correct Makefile
2) Specify the parameters for starting the program in the configuration file (GetWTEC.dia).
3) Run the executable file (GetWTEC).
4) After program stops, the output files will be located in the ‘genout’ 
directory.

Output data:
The output files received as a result of the successful operation of the 
program will be located in the directory genout\YYYY (YYYY – year). For 
each processed site, a file is created with the name SSSSDDD_DDD_YYYYF_PPmin.dat. 
SSSS – site name, DDD_DDD – limits of the interval of processed days, YYYY – year,
PP – window used to remove slow variations, the symbol 'F' indicates that the file
is common for all azimuths. If the ‘GrossDir’ parameter is set in the range from 0
to 360, in addition to the common file for the site, some more files (according to
‘NofDirs’ value) will be created with data divided by azimuth sectors. The names 
of such files will look like SSSSDDD_DDD_YYYYAAA_PPmin.dat (AAA – center of azimuth 
sector). All output files have the same structure. The first lines of output file 
look like this:
__________________________________________________________________________
300	- height of F2-layer maximum
 10	- high filtering period, minutes
 15	- elevation cutoff
0	 =0 - GPS/GLONASS, =1 - GPS, =2 - GLONASS
999	- main direction
  4	- number of directions
tec_filt_aver - averaged through all prns filtered TEC variations
rms - root mean square of TEC averaging
Xaver, Yaver - average position of Ionospheric Pierce Point (km)
N_of_Sats - number of satellites

time_ut, tec_filt_aver, rms, Xaver, Yaver, N_of_Sats
   0.0000   0.0000   0.0000   67.570   14.884 11
   0.0083   0.0000   0.0000   68.378   15.365 11
   0.0167   0.0056   0.0055   69.187   15.841 11

The first 6 lines duplicate the values of the parameters ‘hmax’, ‘highper’, ‘gamcutoff’, 
‘GNSS_crit’, ‘GrossDir’ and ‘NofDirs’ from the file pssint.dia. The following 4 lines 
contain a description of the data columns in the file. ‘tec_filt_aver’ – Wtec data, 
‘rms’ – data spread during averaging over satellites, ‘Xaver’, ‘Yaver’ – deviation of 
the position of the average ionospheric point from the site in kilometers, ‘N_of_Sats’ 
– number of satellites for averaging. The column ‘time_ut’ displays the current time 
count in UT hours from the beginning of the first day ‘daybeg’.
